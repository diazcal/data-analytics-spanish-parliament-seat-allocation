# Maths and Spanish parliament.
Study on the influence of different seat allocation methods in the Spanish parliament composition.

## Hypothesis

## Findings
- Had to invest too much time curating data, both manual and automated:
    - Official data sets are provided in weird formats or complex data structures. I could find standardized data only from non-official sources such as the El Pais newspaper GitLab: https://gitlab.com/elpais/datos 
    - Party names with characters that makes your life much difficult: acute and grave accents, white spaces, etc.
    - There's no way to check party coalitions besides them having a _similar_ name. They're not linked even in the Parliament they will vote the same candidate. E.g.:
        - Mas Pais
        - Mas Pais - Equo
        - Mas Pais - Cha
        - Mas Pais - Andalucia
        - Mas Pais - Candidatura Ecologista
        - Mes Compromis
